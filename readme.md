This is a clone of the Visual Studio Code Powershell Langauge Basics @builtin extension, with a replacement improved syntax tmLangauge file (syntax highlighting) based on an improved version of the original source.

In order to use this extension, you must disable the @builtin extension __Powershell Langauge Basics__.

The primary improvement in the syntax highlighting is regarding using a full statement syntaxing approach, which limits keywords and constructs to only those places where they are valid.

For more information, reference [PowerShell/EditorSyntax PR #156](https://github.com/PowerShell/EditorSyntax/pull/156).  Changes made here are also being posted to that PR.
