# Full Statement Syntax Highlighting for PowerShell

This extension extends the basic PowerShell capabilities of VSCode to include complete full statement syntax highlighting for PowerShell files.

If you are using a theme with semantic token highlighting enabled, and you have a recent PowerShell extension, you must disable semantic token highlighting, in order to insure the this tmLangauge grammar is used to the fullest.

The primary improvement in the syntax highlighting is regarding using a full statement syntax approach, which better discerns the difference between keywords, commands, operators, parameter designators and parameter values.  This makes it possible for your theme to better highlight your code!

For more information, reference [PowerShell/EditorSyntax PR #156](https://github.com/PowerShell/EditorSyntax/pull/156).

This extension is meant as a preview of what PowerShell syntax highlighting could be.
